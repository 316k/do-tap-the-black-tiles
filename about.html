        <h1>About <small><a href="index.html">[back]</a></small></h1>
        <p><strong>Do tap the black tiles</strong> is a clone of <em>Piano tiles : don't tap the white tiles</em> designed for Firefox OS, but available on any device that can run a web browser.</p>
        <p>It is developed by Nicolas Hurtubise (aka me) during his free time. The original game is not free (as in freedom) and comes with advertisement.</p>
        <p>If you have ideas for new modes or for anything that could improve the game, <a href="mailto:316k@legtux.org">let me know !</a></p>
        <p>This game is distributed under the MIT license, and is therefore free software. You can contribute to it directly <a href="https://github.com/316k/do-tap-the-black-tiles">on Github</a>.</p>
